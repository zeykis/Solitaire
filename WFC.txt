We will generate each map using wave funtion collapse algorithm.
The map will be a n*m grid with each tile representing a room. 
The location of a room will influence the type of other rooms in the map.
For exemple, in the context of our game if you're located in a classroom then it eliminates the possibility 
of ending up in another classroom when we exit the room. (Assuming classrooms are not linked together).
There will be a limited number of rooms in the map and the algorithm will generate a map with a limited amount of rooms.
The path between rooms will be generated randomly but with a limited number of tiles between rooms so as not to create a tremendously big map.
It's important to note that the specific rules have not been defined yet and will be defined as we go along.
